Airline Safety 

This project revolves around a data-driven response to counter negative media portrayals of airline safety, highlighting the truth behind airline safety trends through effective data visualization and storytelling. Tasked with changing public perception, the initiative culminates in a meticulously crafted video presentation that combines PowerPoint visuals with a compelling live narrative, designed to communicate the airline's dedication to safety and reliability to both internal stakeholders and the wider public. 

Tableau was used to create the vizualizations throughout htis study.
