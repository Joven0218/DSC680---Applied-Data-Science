Project Title: Addressable Market Quantification and Sales Flywheel Analysis

Overview

This project aims to rigorously quantify and analyze addressable market percentages across several key regions, with a detailed focus on the Tampa Bay area in Florida. 
By investigating sales flywheel patterns, this project derives actionable insights to enhance market penetration strategies, streamline sales processes, and predict flywheel locations.

Background

Understanding the addressable market and the dynamics of sales flywheels is crucial for companies aiming to optimize their market strategies. A sales flywheel creates a self-sustaining cycle where each phase of the sales process feeds into the next, driving continuous growth, 
contrasting with the traditional sales funnel that ends at the point of sale.
