Salary Forecasting and Predictions

Introduction

Problem Statement: This project aims to forecast salary projections related to total human capital using payroll salary data from January 2021 to May 2023. Accurate salary predictions are critical as our organization incurs substantial salary expenses, which amount to over $40M on a revenue book of $550M+. Reliable projections enable well-informed financial decisions, optimized resource allocation, and strategic planning.

Importance: Effective salary forecasting empowers efficient budgeting, resource allocation, proactive workforce planning, compensation equity, and strategic business decisions. It supports our long-term growth, sustainability, and competitiveness.

Target Audience: Key stakeholders include financial planning, HR, and executive teams. External parties such as investors, analysts, and consultants will also benefit from the insights.
