Salary Forecasting Project

Overview
The Salary Forecasting Project is designed to empower our organization with precise and accurate predictions of future salary expenses. Utilizing a comprehensive payroll salary dataset spanning from January 2021 to May 2023, this initiative aims to refine financial planning, optimize resource allocation, and enhance strategic workforce management. By leveraging advanced predictive modeling techniques, we seek to forecast human capital salary expenses with high precision, enabling informed decision-making and strategic planning for our company's future.
