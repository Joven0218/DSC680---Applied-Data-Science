Project Title: Lead Conversion Rate
Description

This project aims to analyze and derive insights from two key datasets: a certificate dataset and CRM leads data. Our goal is to understand the conversion rate from initial leads to finalized sales, identify patterns, and explore factors influencing successful conversions.
Datasets

Certificate Dataset: Contains information on issued certificates, including details such as certificate number, enrollment ID, and closing date. Originates from a SQL database maintained by our organization.
CRM Leads Dataset: Includes data on sales leads tracked via the HubSpot CRM platform, detailing company interactions, lead status, and conversion outcomes.
Usage

The analysis is conducted through a series of Jupyter Notebooks:

Data Cleaning and Preparation: data_preparation.ipynb
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): eda.ipynb
Conversion Rate Analysis: conversion_rate_analysis.ipynb
    
Results

The findings from our analysis are summarized in the results.ipynb notebook and include insights into conversion rates, patterns in non-converting leads, and recommendations for improving sales strategies.
